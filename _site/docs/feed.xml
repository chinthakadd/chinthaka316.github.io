      Contract Testing for Event Driven Architectures: Can We, Do We and How Do We?

In recent past, I had the chance to involve deeply in setting up a developer testing strategy for microservices that follow Event Driven Architecture (EDA) patterns. As a part of this, we performed a deep dive analysis to understand how to introduce Contract Testing to EDA.

While Contract Testing is an important tes...

      Saga Pattern attempts to solve one of the biggest challenges encountered in micro-service architecture in terms of managing transactions across service boundaries. However implementing Sagas is a challenge on its own for us developers (as opposed to ACID transactions) and requires lot more knowledge, experience and research. I am writing this article to share the knowledge I have gathered throu...

      I was writing a small piece of code for a Proof of Concept, and required to write an equals method and was wondering if I had given thought to it in my career of 8 years. Yes I know it, but do I really know it enough. This was the revision exercise I did, which I thought of sharing as an simplistic article with everyone.

These are two very important methods that all Java developers are well aw...

      If you know Helm, you know helm chart repositories. It is like maven repositories, instead these repositories hold onto the
different charts that can be used to install different tools and products into a kubernetes environment. If you are planning to use Helm in your organization to manage your own deployments, lets say your micro-services, then most probably you have come across the need for ...

      I thought of writing this as it is useful starting point for any developer who wants to start
monitoring the JVMs of containers running as Kubernetes Pods.
As I experienced during last few months, JVM optimization is one of the biggest challenges that
enterprises face in moving towards Cloud Platforms with Java based microservices.
As often heard from many platform engineers, Java is “hungry” f...
